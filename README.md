# ExpenceTracker
An expense tracker with a SQL database
# Overview

I used Python and Tkinter to create the UI in order to access and manupulate the SQL database that was built on MySQL Workbench.
With the UI you can create new expences as thay're used and edit them as needed.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}

# Relational Database

In order to create the database there needed to be three different tables.
The first was to keep track of the user with the User ID, Username, and Password.
The second keeps track of the seperate catagories.
The third is the expences themselves, amount, user, and description,.

# Development Environment

VS Code was used for the Python code and MySQL Workbench was used to create the database and tables.
Tkinter was chosen for the GUI to create the UI after looking at PyQt also. 
MySQL Connector is used to access the datebase.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- A better way to search for specific items
- A changable sum total for week, month, year or whatever else is required
- there's an issue adding expences that needs to get fixed.
